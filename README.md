# Start

Run [setup script](#setup-script) or go through installation manually in [Manual process](#manual-process)
After that [Run application](#run-application)

## Setup script 

Firstly install dependencies 

    composer install
    npm install

(could not include them in the setup script as it stops after composer install for some reason)

### On Linux/MacOs

Run the following command to make the script executable:

    chmod +x setup.sh

In the terminal, run the script by executing:

    ./setup.sh

### On Windows 

Run the setup.bat script by double-clicking it or executing it in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

    setup.bat

    php artisan serve

in another terminal - 

    npm run dev
